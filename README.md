## Design
### Overview
Muscle Metrics is designed to offer a user-friendly and visually appealing website tailored for fitness enthusiasts to effectively track and manage their workout progress. The design blends modern aesthetics with practical functionality, creating an engaging and efficient user experience.                                                
### Typography
- **Headings**: Oswald, sourced from Google Fonts, gives a modern and strong character to headings, capturing the user's attention and guiding them through different sections.
- **Text**: Roboto, with sans-serif as the fallback, provides excellent readability for detailed information, ensuring that text is legible across devices and resolutions.                                              

![image](resources/oswald_font.PNG)                   
![image](resources/roboto_font.PNG)               
### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: `#010101` - A deep black for a powerful and elegant backdrop that highlights content.
- **Secondary Background**: `#CCCCCC` - A light grey for card backgrounds or secondary elements, providing a soft contrast.
- **Accent Colour**: `#B11419` - A strong red to call attention to critical elements like alerts or buttons.
- **Text Colour**: `#FFFFFF` - Pure white for primary content, offering maximum contrast for readability.
- **Modal Colour**: `#8BC34A` - A vibrant green for pop up elements, invoking a sense of activity and progress.                                        
- **Modal Colour**:`#E53935` - A vibrant red for error pop up elements, giving a sense of danger.

### Framework
- **Materialize**: A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design principles, enabling me to create a consistent visual and interactive user experience.
### Features and Design         
- **User-Centric Dashboard**: A dark-themed dashboard with cards outlined in `#536767` to categorize the different sections.     
- **Progress Chart Visualization**: Pie and bar charts with a blend of accent colors to differentiate between workout metrics visually.
- **Workout Session Management**: Organized forms with clear text entry in Roboto and section headings in Oswald.
- **Exercise Record**: CRUD functionalities are represented by intuitive icons and buttons, coloured with `#B11419` for recognition and ease of use.
- **Account Management**: A secure login system with input fields and buttons that stand out against the dark background for a focus on security.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layouts that look and function seamlessly on mobile, tablet, or desktop, ensuring accessibility anywhere.
### Usage of Design Elements
1. **Navigation Bar**: Oswald for the logo and main navigation links in white text, with a background colour of `#B11419`.
2. **Buttons**: Materialize-styled buttons with shadows and `#B11419` for primary actions.
3. **Workout Cards**: The workout logs use cards with the Materialize Teal background colour to segment the information cleanly.
4. **Forms**: Input fields with subtle `#CCCCCC` outlines against the `#FFFFFF` background, with placeholder text in Roboto for uniformity.
5. **Modals**: Modals create communication with the user. Along with a message the background colour is used to display success `#8BC34A` and error `#E53935`. These also display a dismissal `x` to dismiss the modal once read. A timer has not been used to dismiss the modals as the user can dismiss the modal once it has been read, ensuring enough time for those with accessibility issues. 
### Accessibility
High contrast colors and legible font choices ensure the design is accessible to users with various needs.
### Conclusion
The design strategy prioritizes user experience with a focus on functionality, aesthetics, and accessibility, creating an environment that motivates and supports the fitness journey of our users.

## CRUD Functionality
### Overview                
This website incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, to enhance user interaction and data management. This functionality is evident and crucial in two key areas of the website: the sign-up process and the management of exercise logs.     
### Sign-Up Process
1. **Create:** During registration, users create their account by entering personal information.                 
2. **Read:** Once registered, users can view their profile information, demonstrating the 'Read' functionality. This step doesn't play a major role during sign-up but is essential in overall user account management.    
3. **Update and Delete:** Although not directly part of the initial sign-up, the ability to update personal information or delete the account is important to the user experience. These features give users control over their data.                
### Logging and Viewing Exercises                   
1. **Create:** Users can log new exercises, adding details such as weight, sets, reps, etc. This process involves creating new records in the user's exercise log.    
2. **Read:** The dashboard enables users to view their logged exercises, providing an  overview of their workout history and progress.        
3. **Update:** Users have the flexibility to update their exercise logs. This could include changing the weight, sets, or other details of their workouts.
4. **Delete:** If necessary, users can delete specific entries in their exercise log through the dashboard, offering control and accuracy in tracking their workout progress.   
### Conclusion           
The integration of CRUD functionality in the sign-up process and exercise log management is fundamental for a dynamic and user-friendly experience. It simplifies data management for users and enhances their interaction with the website, giving a tailored fitness tracking experience.
